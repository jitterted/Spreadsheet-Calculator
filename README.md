## How to Run

Clone the repo and from the parent directory `Spreadsheet-Calculator` run the following commands

- Compile

> Spreadsheet-Calculator$ javac src/main/java/com/rohitsinha/codingchallenge/*.java

- Run

> Spreadsheet-Calculator$ cat input1.txt | java -classpath src/ com.rohitsinha.codingchallenge.Spreadsheet

- For prettyPrint Results

> Spreadsheet-Calculator$ cat input1.txt | java -classpath src/ com.rohitsinha.codingchallenge.Spreadsheet -p

## Testing
The program has been tested on following operating systems:

1. Mac OSX 10.9.2

##To Do
1. Add function headers and improve code documentation. This complete project was developed in less than 4 hours so the documentation kind of sucks :/

##Version
1.0 beta
